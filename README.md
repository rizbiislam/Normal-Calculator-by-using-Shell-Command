## User-Friendly Shell Script Math Assistant

Developed a **multi-functional shell script calculator** capable of performing over 36 mathematical operations. This project allowed me to explore **Bash scripting concepts** and utilize various **shell commands** for user input, calculations, and output.

Created a **versatile command-line calculator** using shell scripting. This script offers users the ability to perform a wide range of mathematical operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, etc.) through a user-friendly interface.

Designed a **customizable shell script calculator** to automate repetitive calculations. The script leverages **Bash scripting principles** and allows users to define variables and perform complex calculations efficiently.
